## Introduction
The library contains two main components:

- A statistics module built around [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
- An implementation of reverse channel coding algorithms discussed in ["Algorithms for the Communication of Samples"](https://research.google/pubs/pub51423/) L. Theis and N. Yosri.
